    // Optional endpoint to generate a single-use, time-limited, `m.login.token` token.
    //
    // Optional endpoint - the server is not required to implement this endpoint if it does not intend to use or support this functionality.  This API endpoint uses the [User-Interactive Authentication API](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api).  An already-authenticated client can call this endpoint to generate a single-use, time-limited, token for an unauthenticated client to log in with, becoming logged in as the same user which called this endpoint. The unauthenticated client uses the generated token in a `m.login.token` login flow with the homeserver.  Clients, both authenticated and unauthenticated, might wish to hide user interface which exposes this feature if the server is not offering it. Authenticated clients can check for support on a per-user basis with the [`m.get_login_token`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#mget_login_token-capability) capability, while unauthenticated clients can detect server support by looking for an `m.login.token` login flow with `get_login_token: true` on [`GET /login`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3login).  In v1.7 of the specification, transmission of the generated token to an unauthenticated client is left as an implementation detail. Future MSCs such as [MSC3906](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3906) might standardise a way to transmit the token between clients.  The generated token MUST only be valid for a single login, enforced by the server. Clients which intend to log in multiple devices must generate a token for each.  With other User-Interactive Authentication (UIA)-supporting endpoints, servers sometimes do not re-prompt for verification if the session recently passed UIA. For this endpoint, servers MUST always re-prompt the user for verification to ensure explicit consent is gained for each additional client.  Servers are encouraged to apply stricter than normal rate limiting to this endpoint, such as maximum of 1 request per minute.

    // Gets information about the owner of a given access token.  Note that, as with the rest of the Client-Server API, Application Services may masquerade as users within their namespace by giving a `user_id` query parameter. In this situation, the server should verify that the given `user_id` is registered by the appservice, and return it in the response body.

    // Authenticates the user, and issues an access token they can use to authorize themself in subsequent requests.  If the client does not supply a `device_id`, the server must auto-generate one.  The returned access token must be associated with the `device_id` supplied by the client or generated by the server. The server may invalidate any access token previously associated with that device. See [Relationship between access tokens and devices](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#relationship-between-access-tokens-and-devices).

All devices for the user are also deleted. [Device keys](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#device-keys) for the device are deleted alongside the device.  This endpoint does not use the [User-Interactive Authentication API](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api) because User-Interactive Authentication is designed to protect against attacks where the someone gets hold of a single access token then takes over the account. This endpoint invalidates all access tokens for the user, including the token used in the request, and therefore the attacker is unable to take over the account in this way.
